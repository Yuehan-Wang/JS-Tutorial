# JavaScript-Tutorial

This course is designed for beginners who had no prior knowledge of coding. 

It will teach students everything they need to know to get started with the front-end programming languages, along with hands-on practices, to a level that they are able to create a simple platform game on their own.  

Students will start with the basics of HTML and CSS to create a webpage with the elements that constitute a game, they will then move to the essence of the course: JavaScript, to make the game interactive. They will be introduced to the fundamentals including data type, arithmetic, variable, function, loop, conditional, and so on. They will get a sense of what object-oriented programming is like, which sets a stepping stone for their future study in other popular programming languages that share the same principle.

Besides the gain in conceptual knowledge, students will also develop soft skills needed to become prospective young researchers: team-work from doing the weekly lab, perseverance from attempting homework set, and confidence from completing a self-made game as their final project.
